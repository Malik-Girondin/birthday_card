                <p>As a father, this brings joy to my heart! My sweet little princess is turning 7 this Friday!</p>
                <p>As an employee at this company for roughly six months, I would like to invite all my co-workers to see my little pumpkin grow up! Nowadays, everyone knows that you job is your secondary family, right? Seriously, I hope this does not come off as to pushy but please come!</p>
                <p>As for details, I will place them below. I want the stress the importance of proper gift giving. To lower the confusion and questions on what to bring. I have an Amazon List of items so just sign in and check off what you can buy for Stacy! Again, no in-person gifts will be accepted! Thank you all! </p>
